## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

In this project, I used Styled Components for the first time. I think it's good for large projects, but not so good for small ones. I'll come up with a bigger on to fully test it.
I also practiced error handling while fetching something.

### Continued development

I'll learn about the other CSS-in-JS libraries and the React best practices.
